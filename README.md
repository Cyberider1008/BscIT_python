List of Practicals

1)a. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. b. Enter the number from the user and depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. c. Write a program to generate the Fibonacci series. d. Write a function that reverses the user defined value. e. Write a function to check the input value is Armstrong and also write the function for Palindrome.

f. Write a recursive function to print the factorial for a given number.
2. Write the program for the following: a. Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True if it is a vowel, False otherwise. b. Define a function that computes the length of a given list or string. c. Define a procedurehistogram() that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example, histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following: **** ********* *******

3. Write the program for the following: a. A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once, for example: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Your task here is to write a function to check a sentence to see if it is a pangram or not. b. Take a list, say for example this one: a=[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89] and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

4. Write the program for the following: a. Write a program that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member. b. Write a Python program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 2nd, 4th and 5th elements. c. Write a Python program to clone or copy a list

5. Write the program for the following: a. Write a Python script to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value. b. Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one. Sample Dictionary : dic1={1:10, 2:20} dic2={3:30, 4:40} dic3={5:50,6:60} Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60} c. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a dictionary.

6. Write the program for the following: a. Write a Python program to read an entire text file. b. Write a Python program to append text to a file and display the text. c. Write a Python program to read last n lines of a file.

7. Write the program for the following: a. Design a class that store the information of student and display the same b. Implement the concept of inheritance using python c. Create a class called Numbers, which has a single class attribute called MULTIPLIER, and a constructor which takes the parameters x and y (these should all be numbers). i. Write a method called add which returns the sum of the attributes x and y. ii. Write a class method called multiply, which takes a single number parameter a and returns the product of a and MULTIPLIER. iii. Write a static method called subtract, which takes two number parameters, b and c, and returns b - c. iv. Write a method called value which returns a tuple containing the values of x and y. Make this method into a property, and write a setter and a deleter for manipulating the values of x and y.
